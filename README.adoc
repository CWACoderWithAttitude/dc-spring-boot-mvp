:description: Spring Boot DevContainer with postgres.
:keywords: devcontainer, spring boot, rest api, testing, persistence, postgres
:revnumber: 0.1.0
:revdate: 2025-06-04

== TL;DR
DevContainer for Spring Boot & Postgres that gets you started with building production grade REST services that use postgres for persistence.

> This is a stripped down version of https://github.com/CWACoderWithAttitude/dc-spring-boot-all-in-one[dc-spring-boot-all-in-one] which is a full blown devcontainer for building REST APIs with Spring Boot. It includes a lot of additional features like monitoring, testing, and more.

== What's inside?
This is an opinionated devcontainer for building REST APIs with Spring Boot. Setup ships with postgres persistence.
It is not meant to be a complete solution for all use cases. It rather get you started.
If you have any suggestions or feedback, please let me know.

Let's have a look at the main components:

* OpenJDK 21 
* Spring Boot 3.5.0
* Maven 3.9.9
* Postgres DB 14.1
* Adminer
* JaCoCo
* Bruno

== Components

=== Spring Boot - OpenJDK 21
Develop your Spring Boot 3.5 Service on OpenJDK 21. 

For illustration I added an example REST-Service that manages data on games. 
This service exposes some technical metrics: JVM, Hibernate, Spring-Booot (Requests, Errors, etc.) and application specific metrics like the number of games in the database. 

To assist your journey of building high quality web services:

- http://localhost:8088/swagger-ui/index.html[Swagger / Open-API info is exposed].

- Mavens JaCoCo plugin generates code coverage reports each time run `./mvnw package`.
The report is stored in `target/site/jacoco/index.html`. (Use the included https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer[Live server] extension to view the report in your browser.)

- Basic build pipeline based on GitHub Actions is included. It runs the tests, builds the app and generates the JaCoCo report.
The JaCoCo-Report is published to the https://cwacoderwithattitude.github.io/dc-spring-boot-all-in-one/[project website]

==== Architecture Diagram

A picture is worth a thousand words. So let's have a look at the architecture diagram of the devcontainer.

=== Testing

I ship my examples with https://www.usebruno.com[Bruno] collections.

Please find the ganes api collection in the `bruno` folder.

You can import them into Bruno by clicking on the `+` icon in the top left corner and selecting `Import Collection`.

There's a CLI tool to run collections, too:
```
❯ bru run . --reporter-html results.html
Running Folder

> I like Bruno - open source, local execution, no cloud services required. 
Support for GUI and CLI. Excellent support for adding asserts and test to your requests.

=== Persistence

Is implemented by MS SQL 2022. 
This setup ships with an empty database. Using Bruno you can easily create items or upload the a set of default games. By default the service default games are loaded from file:///./games-service/src/(resources/board-games.json[] on startup if the db is empty.


=== Monitoring

Never underestimate the importance of monitoring your app. It is crucial to know how your app is doing in production. For the sake of simplicity the demo app exposes default Spring Boot Actuator endpoints. This includes metrics, health, info and more.

Processing, rendering or gathering metrics is out of scope of this example.

=== DB Frontend

To make is as easy for you as possible i included difffent ways to peek into the datase. One is a web based GUI, the other is a CLI tool.

=== GUI

Adminer is a web based DB management tool that can be used to manage your database. It can be reached at http://localhost:8010/?pgsql=db.local&username=postgres&db=postgres&ns=public&table=game[http://localhost:8010 > DB Adminer]. Please lookup the DB password fron file://.devcontainer/.env[.env] file.

=== Why DevContainer?
When developing a REST API you need to think about a lot of things.

You need to think about how to implement and test your code. And make sure it runs in a container.

This is a lot of stuff to think about. So I thought it would be a good idea to build a full blown REST API that covers all these topics. The goal is to show you how to do all this stuff in a simple way. The goal is not to build the best API ever. 

==== Works on my machine!

We all "know"this is a bad slogan. But what if "works on my machine" simply means: great - ship it. What if we could turn "works on my machine" into "works in a container"? An envirnment that is consistent regardless of the host system.

=== Why devcontainers?
I want to show you why we should embrace the slogan "It works on my machine". Using devcontainers it is easy to build a product in an environment that's pretty close to your prod env.



Let's face it - we all have different machines and different setups. When using containers starting from day one you can be suree

:description: Spring Boot DevContainer with postgres.
:keywords: devcontainer, spring boot, rest api, testing, persistence, postgres
:revnumber: 0.1.0
:revdate: 2025-06-04

== TL;DR
DevContainer for Spring Boot & Postgres that gets you started with building production grade REST services that use postgres for persistence. Just start theis setup in VSCode and you're in the Dev-Game.

> This is a stripped down version of https://github.com/CWACoderWithAttitude/dc-spring-boot-all-in-one[dc-spring-boot-all-in-one] which is a full blown devcontainer for building REST APIs with Spring Boot. It includes a lot of additional features like monitoring, testing, and more.

== What's inside?
This is an opinionated devcontainer for building REST APIs with Spring Boot. Setup ships with postgres persistence.
It is not meant to be a complete solution for all use cases. It rather get you started.
If you have any suggestions or feedback, please let me know.

Let's have a look at the main components:

* OpenJDK 21 
* Spring Boot 3.5.0
* Maven 3.9.9
* Postgres DB 17.5
* Bruno Collection

All this implements this API

== Components

=== Spring Boot - OpenJDK 21
Develop your Spring Boot 3.5 Service on OpenJDK 21. 

For illustration I added an example REST-Service that manages data on games. 
This service exposes some technical metrics: JVM, Hibernate, Spring-Booot (Requests, Errors, etc.) and application specific metrics like the number of games in the database. 

To assist your journey of building high quality web services:

- Swagger / Open-API info is exposed on http://localhost:8088/swagger-ui/index.html[/swagger-ui/index.html].

- Mavens JaCoCo plugin generates code coverage reports each time run `./mvnw package`.
The report is stored in `target/site/jacoco/index.html`. (Use the included https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer[Live server] extension to view the report in your browser.)

- Basic build pipeline based on GitHub Actions is included. It runs the tests, builds the app and generates the JaCoCo report.
The JaCoCo-Report is published to the https://cwacoderwithattitude.github.io/dc-spring-boot-mvp/[project website]

== How to use this devcontainer?
=== Pre-Requisites
To use this devcontainer, you need to have the following prerequisites installed:

- https://code.visualstudio.com[Visual Studio Code] and
- https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers[Remote - Containers extension for VS Code]

Once you have these prerequisites installed, you can open the devcontainer in VS Code.

=== Open the DevContainer

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/CWACoderWithAttitude/dc-spring-boot-mvp.git
cd dc-spring-boot-mvp
```
[numbered, start=2]
2. Open the repository in Visual Studio Code.
You can do this by either opening the folder in VS Code or by using the command line:
```
code -n .
```   
[numbered, start=3]
3. Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P on macOS) and select `Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container...`.



Default settings start the game-service on local port 9088.

The service implements a REST service that manages games. It allows you to create, read, update and delete games. 

The http://localhost:8088/swagger-ui/index.html#/[Game-Service Open-API] page show an overview of available endpoints.


You can access the service at http://localhost:8088[http://localhost:8088].
See file://Makefile[Makefile] for a list of commands to run the service, tests, and more.
The make target fires up the spring-boot:run command which listens for file changes and automatically reloads the service when you change the code.

=== Makefile

The `Makefile` in the root folder provides convenient commands for building, running, testing, and maintaining the project. Below is a list of available targets:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Target | Description

| `check_docker_compose_config`
| Validates the Docker Compose configuration for the devcontainer.

| `sb_clean`
| Cleans the Maven build artifacts for the game-service module.

| `sb_build`
| Builds the game-service module using Maven and creates a JAR file.

| `sb_run`
| Starts the game-service Spring Boot application in development mode (auto-reloads on code changes).

| `sb_debug`
| Starts the game-service Spring Boot application in debug mode (listening on port 8000 for a debugger).

| `build`
| Builds the Docker image for the game-service.

| `run`
| Runs the game-service Docker container (builds the image first if needed).

| `asciidoc2docbook`
| Converts AsciiDoc documentation to DocBook XML using Asciidoctor in Docker.

| `clean`
| Removes generated documentation files and build artifacts.

| `docbook2md`
| Converts DocBook XML documentation to Markdown using Pandoc in Docker.

| `generate_markdown`
| Cleans, converts AsciiDoc to DocBook, then to Markdown (full documentation conversion pipeline).
|===

To use a target, run `make <target>` in the project root. For example, `make sb_run` will start the application.

For more details, see the `Makefile` itself.



==== Architecture Diagram

A picture is worth a thousand words. So let's have a look at the architecture diagram of the devcontainer.

=== Testing

I ship my examples with https://www.usebruno.com[Bruno] collections.

Please find the games api collection in the `bruno` folder.

You can import them into Bruno by clicking on the `+` icon in the top left corner and selecting `Import Collection`.


There's a CLI tool to run collections, too:
```
❯ bru run . --reporter-html results.html

> I like Bruno - open source, local execution, no cloud services required. 
Support for GUI and CLI. Excellent support for adding asserts and test to your requests.

=== Persistence

Is implemented by Postgres
This setup ships with an empty database. Using Bruno you can easily create items or upload the a set of default games. By default the service default games are loaded from file:///./games-service/src/(resources/board-games.json[] on startup if the db is empty.


=== Monitoring

Never underestimate the importance of monitoring your app. It is crucial to know how your app is doing in production. The demo app exposes default Spring Boot Actuator endpoints. This includes metrics, health, info and more. Some technical spring boot metrics. GamesController shows how to expose custom metrics.

For the sake of simplicity processing, rendering or gathering metrics is out of scope of this example.

Please refer to the "all-in-one" version.

=== DB Frontend

Adminer is a web based DB management tool that can be used to manage your database. It can be reached at http://localhost:8010/?pgsql=db.local&username=postgres&db=postgres&ns=public&table=game[http://localhost:8010 > DB Adminer]. Please lookup the DB password fron file://.devcontainer/.env[.env] file.

=== Why DevContainer?

When developing a REST API you need to think about a lot of things.

You need to think about how to implement and test your code. And make sure it runs in a container.

This is a lot of stuff to think about. So I thought it would be a good idea to build a full blown REST API that covers all these topics. The goal is to show you how to do all this stuff in a simple way. The goal is not to build the best API ever. 

==== Works on my machine!

We all "know"this is a bad slogan. But what if "works on my machine" simply means: great - ship it. What if we could turn "works on my machine" into "works in a container"? An envirnment that is consistent regardless of the host system.

=== Why devcontainers?
I want to show you why we should embrace the slogan "It works on my machine". Using devcontainers it is easy to build a product in an environment that's pretty close to your prod env.



Let's face it - we all have different machines and different setups. When using containers starting from day one you can be suree
